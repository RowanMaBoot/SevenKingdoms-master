TAI_START_NAME;The Andal Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAI_START_DESC;With the aggressive expansion of the domineering Valyrian Empire, it was inevitable that one day the Andal Kingdom would fall to fire and brimstone. Indeed, even the fair republic of Lorath would fall with it, and so the last of the Andals would flee west to a new land inhabited by the native First Men.\n\nThis would begin a new age of bloodshed, for the Andals did not seek integration with the natives, but rather strove to carve out Kingdoms of their own, built upon the bones of the First Men and their Old Gods.\n\nThis kind of rapid expansion by an outside force can only lead to further destruction. Will the First Men assimilate into the ranks of the zealous Andals? Or will they push back the invaders and secure a brighter future for their kind? You will decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

IRONBORN_START_DESC;Under the Driftwood KJing Qhored I Hoare the realm of the Ironborn reached the peak of its expansion, and it was said that all the western coast of Westeros where the salt of the Sunset Sea could be smelt or the crashing of its waves heard were under their control. Over the centuries the power of the Ironborn would diminish, and many of their forefathers' conquests lost, but at this point in time that seemed to be but a dream, for reality was a nightmare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

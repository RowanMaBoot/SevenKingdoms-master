EVTtitletsk_cc.1;Invasion of Bear Island!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.1;The Ironborn could be aptly described as close kin to weeds, if left unchecked they will slowly, but, surely overwhelm your garden. For centuries Bear Island has been contested between the Starks and the Glovers, more recently it was manned by man-at-arms from Deepwood Motte, that was until the Reavers from Orkmont arrived. Now House Stark enjoys a position of primacy among the northern Kings, and as such this southern incursion is the perfect opportunity to re-establish our control over the island.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.1;Assemble a fleet!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.11;Dark wings, dark words, we received word that the Kings of Winter begun amassing strength at Winterfell intent on taking our islands in the Bay of Ice!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.11;Summon the Captains!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.111;After a bloody struggle we finally managed to beat the ironman from Bear Island, now we must fortify and aptly man the island so that our western shores remain steadfast in its defense.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.111;You hear great feats from one House Mormont, maybe they should man the island.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk_cc.111;Maybe i should ponder over this some more.;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc2_dec;The White Knife problem;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc2_dec_desc;Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitletsk_cc.2;The Starks from The White Knife;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.2;Since the Boltons sought protection from the Andals in Winterfell, our dominion over much of the North became a matter of great alarm to the nobles and petty Kings north of the Neck, of all the discontent nobility most surprising of all are the Greystarks, once an offshoot of House Stark, this cadet branch clearly does not appreciate the newfound eminence of the Kings of Winter, to make matters worse discomforting news that they for some time have been scheming with the lords of the Dreadfort, leave us with no recourse but to wage war upon these unruly nobles.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.2;We must strike first before the Boltons can reinforce their allies.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.22;The warmongers of House Stark finally knocks in our doors, its been centuries since the Wolf gave this barren and war-torn piece of shore to us, and since then we only suffered under their yoke, no more, with our Boltons allies we will drive the bloodthirsty direwolf back to its lair!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.22;Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.222;Dark wings, dark words. A raven arrived from the White Knife, House Stark finally decided to march on their unruly offshoot, this is the chance we been waiting, the andal invasion is over and we need no more meddling from Winterfell!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.222;Call the Banners;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.2222;The White Knife once again falls under the Stark banner, and with it our control over the North solidify, its true that rebellion stirred first close at home, but it was reinforced by House Bolton, which was permitted to keep most of its dominions and titles once they submitted, but, now its clear that was a mistake, our troops will need to endure another campaign if there is to be peace in the North.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.2222;Maybe we should style ourselfs King in the North...;;;;;;;;;x
dreadfort_subjugation;We march to the Dreadfort!;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc3_dec;War for the Neck;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc3_dec_desc;Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitletsk_cc.3;The Crannogmen;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.3;House Stark has recently vanquished or subjugate most threats, external or internal, to its rule in the North, conquering lands in the west, as well as the east, while its northern borders count with the assuring sight of the Wall, there is still one causeway open to the heart of our dominion, the Neck, located south of Winterfell, these swamps and bogs, said to be the result of a mishap in an ancient ritual held by the Children, prove a mighty natural fortress to the crannogmen, soon it will prove a mighty natural defense to the North.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.3;I heard some crannogmen ride lizard-lions to war!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.33;Some hunters awhile back came to us with tall-tales of armies converging north of the swamps, then we did not pay much care to those news, if true at all, we thought it was just another petty squabble between northern Lords, but, as the direwolf banners of House Stark now enter our swamps their intentions are clear as day.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.33;To war!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.333;With the surrender of the Swamp King, one of the most geographical important locations of the North now falls under our control, and, with growing andal incursions plaguing all of Westeros, here we will make our stand, with the fortress of Moat Cailin, and now our swamps, we could easily throw back hosts ten times the size of our own.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.333;Maybe i should marry one of their princess...;;;;;;;;;x
crannog_marriage;It sure would help in bringing the crannogmen peacefully into the realm...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk_cc.333;Back to Winterfell!;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc4_dec;Resume building the Eyrie;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc4_dec_desc;King Roland Arryn, believing that the Gates of the Moon was vastly inferior to other castles and strategically vulnerable to raids from the mountain clans, started plans to build a new royal palace high in the mountain above the Gates of the Moon, it's up to you to finish it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTtitletsk_cc.4;The Eyrie Halls;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.4;Since Roland I reign much need infrastructural progress has been made at the Eyrie, especially on the waycastles guarding the narrow stone steps leading to the only means of reaching your new castle, it's defenses already formidable some of your household feel that it's time to transform these cold, unfinished halls into something worthy of House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName].\n\nTo that end, the current hall set apart for receiving guests is a prime target for renovations, currently a crude thing, heavily masked with banners and tapestries hiding it's state of neglect, with some money and time, this could become a magnificent room, on pair of any of the Great Halls of Westeros...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.4;Remember the men to buy more silk with your colors...;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc44_dec;The Eyrie Towers;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc44_dec_desc;According to Roland I original plans construction on one of the peaks of the Giant's Lance began by laying the foundations of seven slim towers, during building the Moon Tower and the Maiden's Tower have taken precedence over the other five, on account of being lodging for The Eyrie lord and his guest, respectively, while some progress has been made on the castle, it's high time serious investment in bring it to life is made...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.44;Plans have been finally laid out regarding the finishing of The Eyrie other 5 towers, the work will be expensive, a sept, godswood, expansions to the granary and new halls all will take a extreme toll on the realms finances, your castellan winces at any talk of extra expenses, but, you assure him it all will be worth it...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.44;More white marble will be needed...;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc444_dec;Finish The Eyrie;;;;;;;;;x
tsk_cc444_dec_desc;The castle is almost finished, some final decorations here and there and a new way of reaching the castle that does not involve climbing the handholds carved in the rock leading up from Sky are being discussed...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.444;Your master engineer guarantees you that this device will work, you look at it again, baskets and huge oaken buckets being pulled by winches, "Gods!", you think, it's the only real idea anyone has put forward as an alternative way to reach the Eyrie, and a needed one, as many of your vassals refuse visiting the almost finished castle thanks to its treacherous climb, seeing no other alternative you approve the construction...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.444;The castle is almost complete!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.41;Apparently the foreman has been hounding your castellan in regards of more funding, citing an endless list of necessities the man asks for more money each passing day, he also says that while money would speed things up new able bodied workers would just as well help with the construction...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.41;Here's the coin, no more no less!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk_cc.41;Round up some of the smallfolk for work with promise of payment...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCtsk_cc.41;Put some prisoners to work...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.42;Work on the Eyrie has stopped, what you and your men originally set out to accomplish has been finished, now the only thing left to do is enjoy the fruit of your labors...;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCtsk_cc.6;For some time your heir [Root.Heir.GetFirstName] has been attended by healers and drowned men everyday, to no avail, [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] health continues to deteriorate with no signs of improving, you remember something your father used to say, about Harlaw Hall shoddy walls and those damned waves, it makes all the sense now...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.6;Maybe some changes are in order!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk_cc.6;Just leave me be...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk_cc.66;A year has passed since House [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] lost it's heir due to [tt_heir.GetHerHis] ailing health, a tragic end which [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has blamed in it's entirety on the old keep, Harlaw Hall.\n\nSupposedly built by the Harlaw descendants of the Grey King the castle is prone to flooding, with each phase of the moon bringing in sea-water inside the bowels of the castle, leaving its halls damp, with a unbearable salty atmosphere about it.\n\nSome of your men have put forth the idea of renovating the old castle, using the ample wealth of the island to finance some improvements, but, in your mind half measures will only lead to another disaster...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk_cc.66;We will start building immediately!;;;;;;;;;x

dyn_stab_bastard;Dynastic Stability;;;;;;;;;x
dyn_stab_bastard_desc;You currently lack an able bodied heir to which pass your lands once you're dead, this predicament has left your realm vulnerable as you can already see not only external, but, internal problems arising, as nobles begin circling around your domains like vultures to a carcass. Not all is lost though, some of your adventures as a teen have led to a fruitful conception, this bastard boy has been kept safe and relatively unknow to your court...;;;;;;;;;x

dyn_stab_relative;A Distant Heir;;;;;;;;;x
dyn_stab_relative_desc;As you're faced with the diminishing state of your dynasty and your own life issues you feel like there's a urgent need to appoint a heir, some of your advisors have put forward names in regards to who should be chosen as the new ruler of [Capital.GetFirstName], but, §Ma closer inspection of your family tree might reveal other more interesting candidates§!...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk.0991;For some time one of your courtiers, a man claiming some neighboring lands has enjoyed your protection, at first you decided to keep him in your service to monitor the situation, but, nothing ever came of it since what he asked of you was a task to grand for a reward to small, recently though, with enough funding and mercenaries gathered from years of service rendered to you the man approaches your advisors once more with the same petition, help him reclaim his ancestral lands, after which he would in turn pledge fealty and recognize you as Lord...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk.0991;I will hear what the has to say, inform him I will grant him an audience...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk.0991;Actually, this seems like a terrible idea...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk.0992;You've spent the next hours hearing what the young man has to say, looking at maps and hearing the opinions of your trusted advisors, in general this seems all well thought out, the coin and men provided as backup will certainly boost this cause greatly, but, as always though the final decision rests solely with you, should you embark on this conquest or not?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk.0992;We march to war. Call the banners!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtsk.0993;The war is over and you've managed to recover your ancestral seat with the help of a neighboring Lord, as per your agreement the price for his troops was swearing fealty to his House for eternity, will you honor this pact or forge your own path...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtsk.0993;I've given my word, let no men say I lack honor!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtsk.0993;A deal made with a bloodthirsty lunatic means nothing to me!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1226;[From.GetSheHeCap] had no right to speak to me in that fashion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1227;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] listened to our request to fight, and instead of agreeing took us each aside in turn and spoke to us calmly. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it would be unfortunate if either of us were hurt, as it would be a breach of hospitality, and begged us to reconsider...and [From.GetSheHe] was right. It was a foolish idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1227;Another time, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1228;Those guest at the keep gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledName], overseen by [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [From.GetHerHim]self.

EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1228;Most unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1228;The bastard killed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_wedding_1228;Ha! [From.GetSheHe] had it coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_emf_wedding_1228;How scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1229;Those guests at the keep gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [wedding_duel_host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [wedding_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] lost the duel and was badly wounded. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1229;There, it is done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1229;[From.GetSheHe] must have cheated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_wedding_1229;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1230;Those guests at the keep gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [wedding_duel_host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [wedding_duel_host.GetHerHim]self.

EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1231;Those guests at the keep gathered as a duel ensued between [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.GetTitledName], overseen by [wedding_duel_host.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] [wedding_duel_host.GetHerHim]self. The fight was a spectacle...and, in the end, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] was stabbed by [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and died!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1232;The wedding celebrations were going so well...and then you saw [Spouse.GetFirstName]'s lover, there across the room, laughing and as brazen as [Root.GetSheHe] pleased. How could [Spouse.GetSheHe] invite [Root.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1232;[Spouse.GetSheHeCap] does this to spite me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1233;The wedding celebrations were going so well...and then you saw [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] staring daggers at you. [From.GetSheHeCap] accosted you in front of your guests, making a scene over the fact your lover was present at the wedding! Eventually [From.GetSheHe] stormed off, but it was an embarrassing moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1233;That could have gone...better;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1234;The wedding's festivities are going well...so well, in fact, that the muse has overtaken you. Perhaps an ode to your host, publicly declared for all to hear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1234;Yes! Wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1234;No, I couldn't bear the shame;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1235;At one point in the wedding's festivities, [From.GetTitledName] stands and gets everyone's attention. [From.GetSheHe] delivers a poem in [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s honor...and it is beautiful. Those gathered are moved, and the applause afterwards signifies that this ode will be written down and remembered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1235;Well done, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1235;I couldn't be more pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_wedding_1235;How fabulous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1236;At one point in the wedding's festivities, [From.GetTitledName] stands and gets everyone's attention. [From.GetSheHe] delivers a poem in [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s honor...and it is terrible. Did [From.GetSheHe] intend to insult [From.GetHerHis] host, or was it an accident? The awkward coughs afterwards signify this moment is best forgotten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1236;Awkward, indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1236;No, this is terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_wedding_1236;How awful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1238;To our good host, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], long may [Root.GetSheHe] reign!'\n\n[From.GetTitledName] stands and delivers an eloquent toast in [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s honor at one of the wedding celebrations, prompting a round of approving applause from those gathered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1238;Many thanks, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1238;Long may [Root.GetSheHe] reign!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1240;In one of the banquets you sponsor in honor of the wedding, it seems everyone wants to dance with you. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] in particular, however, seems more interested than most. The way [From.GetSheHe] smiles at you, you suspect [From.GetSheHe] might be interested in more than just a dance with the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1240;Oh, really? Let's see where this goes...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1240;A dance is more than sufficient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1242;In one of the banquets you sponsor in honor of the wedding, it seems every [Root.GetManWomanOpp] wishes to dance with you. How tiresome. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] winks in your direction, seeming to understand your discomfort. Indeed, you suspect [From.GetSheHe] might understand better than most...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1242;Let's talk in private, [From.GetFirstName]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1242;I'm not interested in [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1244;Across the grand hall you can hear it, [From.GetTitledName] has done nothing more than make caustic remarks about you when [From.GetSheHe] thinks you're not listening. You're not even certain why [From.GetSheHe] came to the wedding at all, if this is how [From.GetSheHe] feels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1244;Endure itit's only one evening, after all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1244;Confront [From.GetHerHim]this needs to stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1246;As if [From.GetHerHis] drinking weren't bad enough, [From.GetTitledName] managed to make quite the spectacle of [From.GetHerHim]self at the one of the banquets, dancing on tables and carrying on until finally [From.GetSheHe] vomited on the floor in front of everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1246;Oh, wonderful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1248;For most of the ball, [From.GetTitledName] acted normally...or as normally as one can expect [From.GetHerHim] to be, perhaps. Then a servant placed the wrong flagon before [From.GetHerHim], and that set him off: ranting and raving, until finally the hall watched in silence as [From.GetSheHe] was escorted away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1248;You could hear [From.GetHerHim] screaming from the halls...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_wedding_1275;Now trully the last of the wedding celebrations are drawing to a close, with [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] giving alms to the smallfolk still gathered around the castle walls, even they are dispersing, 'Long live the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]! Long live the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!' can be heard, as everyday life returns to [From.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_emf_wedding_1275;Let's hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_emf_wedding_1275;A fine event, indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020N;The last of your wedding guests began making their travel preparations, clearly impressed by the opulence of the festivities they are quick to change the date of their departing, snowfall being one of the most common excuses your bannermen use while enjoying your bountiful hospitality, it doesn't bother you, after all, your northman will never forget the power you displayed here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020BB;All over your halls you still see your guests, the festivities filling your keep with life, it's been days since the wedding but lords from all over the Blackwater are still lodged in your castle, truly, this event is sure to help you in the years to come in these wartorn lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020D;Your castellan assures you theres nothing to worry, dornish red, exotic spices, meat and salt are all well stocked and ready to be served, the festivities you're holding in the water gardens which has been an ongoing afair for close to a month could keep going for another one, he assures you, satisfied you take another sip of wine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020II;It's been a long time since you last saw so many captains united in celebration, that didn't involve a succesful raid at least, once the drowned priest concluded the ceremony, your servants rushed in with many exotic meryments, which you boastful states were all acquired by paying the iron price, it's been weeks since that and you can still see many ships anchored in your harbor...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020S;The vast quantities of wine and meat still being served at your halls astound your guests, the Stormlands are not known for their ample fields and wealthy nobility, but, somehow what you display here comes close, you have every right to be as proud as you can, as the grand celebrations you're hosting shall continue with no dimishing grandeur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020R;Even for the Reach the sheer abundance you're displaying has the nobles gathered in your festivities talking, "Good!", you think, for the reachmen sometimes wealth displayed is more effective then whatever force you could ever muster, and, you sure mustered everything you could for this occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020RI;Downstream you can see miles of tents, the smallfolk have gathered outside your castle for this merry occasion on the word of how grandiose it was, inside your walls however the festivities now well into its second week have yet to die out, surely, the pomp of the first day, and, it's more prestigious guests are gone, but minor Lords and family still enjoy your vast hospitality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020V;You've planned this wedding meticulously, the more festive part of it dying out after the first week, you retained grand part of your nobles with promises of tourneys to be held with significant winnings to its champion, your guests have responded well, many still honouring your grand event with their presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72020W;There's scarcely a way to display power through wealth when most of the distinguished Houses in the west sit upon lush mines, but, you surely did your best, your galleries are full of eastern tapestries, the tables were and are still filled with all kinds of exotic foods and the wine, be it from Dorne or the Arbour, is nowhere near ending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LAVISH72020;It was all worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021N;The last of your wedding guests began making their travel preparations, those who still linger are hurriedly trying to settle small administrative matters, winter being one of the chief concers amongst your bannermen, it doesn't bother you, after all, here in the North every drop of grain matters once white takes over the landscape...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021BB;Some of your sworn swords still haven't left, most alarming is the fact that some of then are in charge of key fortications along your borders, you try as best you can accomodating your Lords needs for funds and arms, after all here in the Blackwater war is a every day occurence, be it from the stormlords, reavers or across the Narrow Sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021D;Reports of highwaymen prowling the caravan routes in this high dornish heat has retained some of your wedding guests inside your walls, your servants assure you nothing will be wanted during their stay, it seems your water gardens will resume hosting some afternoon merryments for the next couple days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021II;One thing is for sure, a man has a finite amount of finger's, it's been some days since the more rowdy bunch have left your walls, there's been no more finger dancing, as the captains that are still anchored all remained for more serious matters, new raids, different ports and wildly fictious reports of loot all high on their priorities...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021S;The men you sent to secure more wine and meat have returned after completing their task, the uncertainty of sending ships to sea here on the Stormlands on such a important matter made you take a risky gamble, but it paid off, you have nothing to worry anymore and the guests still lodged in your keep shall continue to do so withn no dimishing confort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021R;After the wedding ceremony you're still hosting some minor Houses and landed nobility sworn to your banners, even if you didn't displayed enormours pomp during the wedding and feast proper, these small gestures of hospitality and patronage do go a long way here in the Reach in solidifying your House's standings amongst it's peers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021RI;Talk of military affairs preocupy your halls after the wedding, the Riverlands, since the Age of Heroes, has been considered a proving ground, a crossroads between Kingdoms, always desired, so with a new alliance secured some of your bannermen remain in your keep to discuss matters of political importance with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021V;Talk of clansmen stalking mountain roads have stalled some of your guests in leaving, your castellan soothes your worst fears related to your guests needs, it seems your conservative spending during the wedding preparations have born fruit sooner than you imagined, nevertheless, you send for your captain of guards, these marauders have to be stopped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72021W;Most of the distinguished guests have already taken leave of your halls, but, some still remain mostly those sworn to directly to your House since time immemorial, always dependant of your fortunes, they confraternize amongst themselves, always aggrandizing, and, most desperatly of all, a nobler match.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
AVERAGE72021;An event well concluded!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022N;The last of your wedding guests began making their travel preparations, these fourth sons, bastards and young man-at-arms who still linger try desperatly finding any form of employment that can guarantee a roof over their heads, these small matters apart, work in restoring the castle to its former state before the modest ceremony is almost complete...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022BB;Of your original guests pratically only your inlaws haven't left yet, concerned about key points in your alliance long since discussed and agreed upon, you try as best you can accomodating their new needs and demands, after all here in the Blackwater alliances are almost a necessity if ones to survive, you wonder maybe a more pompous ceremony would've helped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022D;Your modest festivities long gone, just a handful of closer acquaintances remain, you order your household to share whatever's left from the feast with the beggars outside your walls, you known it isn't much, but, it sure beats whatever the desperate souls will find in the desert...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022II;Some of your most loyal captains are still anchored, concern around reaving and the Kingdoms borders flaring up in during council, you make conservative promisses, and, give them some more or less real assurances, their fears abated by now you finally begin seeing them off your shores.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022S;The Stormlands were always known to be a land of harsh mountains, stony shores and lush forests, so whatever hospitility you manage to supply your guests with is always well received, your bannermen taking their leave in a ordly fashion, the hardy stormlanders always in high spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022R;After the small wedding ceremony you're still hosting some man-at-arms, always eager in securing employment amongst the Reach noble Houses, even if you didn't displayed enormours wealth during the event, these men known there will always be opportunity for service amongst the Reach nobility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022RI;Now married you take to the field once more, with a new alliance secured and a small stream of new blood brought by news of the occasion gives a good spin to a most humble and calm event, your treasury not depleted of funds maybe it's time you started some works around some of the fords near your keep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022V;The last of your guests finally leaving it takes little effort by your servants in putting everything back in order, in the mountains of the Vale once snow begins to settle one has to be ready in making a move away from the mountains, least you fancy freezing to death, that's the reason for such a rushed affair, you keep telling yourself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC72022W;A most discret affair has taken place in your halls, the last of the decorations finally going down, you quickly give orders to your household, quickly discard everything thats useful near the smallfolk are camped, quicker they pick their prizes, the quicker they will be back in the mines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BUDGET72022;We did what we could under the circumstances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

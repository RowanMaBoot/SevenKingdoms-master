EVTTITLE_AOPK.1;The Andal Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.1;In the Riverlands the horns sound as nine Kings lead their hosts to war. In the North the noble house Stark continues to expand their borders and influence. In the West, the dominance of the Rock is now challenged by the emergence of new kingdoms in the Golden Hills. To the South, the Marshals and High King of the Reach continue their policy of internal squabbling whilst being raided by Andals and Dornish alike. In the Vale a young bronzeman raises his banners against the young fool of a falcon. One thing is for certain however, the final battle between the now two peoples of Westeros draws ever nearer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.2;For thousands of years the walls and swords of the southern lordlings have kept the tide of our people at bay. Yet their time comes to an end soon. We will scale their wall of ice, we will sack their houses of stone, we will take their women as our own. This we shall do in the coming years. We are the Free Folk, the oldest and strongest of the peoples of this accursed continent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.3;With the death of Iron King Harras, a new King worthy of the seastone chair was to be elected. The Lord-Reavers and Lesser-Lords of the Kingdom of Salt and Rock met upon the plains of Orkmont to decide this royal question. Yet, none of the candidates could gain enough votes. Among them were Harrag Hoare, Victarion Harlaw, Dunstan Drumm, and Gormond Goodbrother. All were equally capable of leading the Ironborn to many great victories, and so Harrag proposed that they should all rule as Kings, and their allies should become their vassals, and they would engage in warfare until the Drowned God chose the rightful successor of his domain, and so it was decided.... What is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.4;Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_AOPK.5;The domination of the Valyrian Freehold in western Essos is ensured. The Viceroy dictates his servants from the Silver Palace of Lys, one of the grandest cities in the known world. The Freehold will never fall in our lifetimes that is for certain. Slaves from all over the world mine in the endless chasms of Valyria. Its influence can be felt as far as Blackwater Bay and beyond. All is done under the eyes and shadow of the dragon. Thousands of Valyrians flood into the western territories to begin its colonization. The wizards from the fourteen flames tell of a Golden Age that is set to begin soon for the Valyrians. Kesi undegon ia qeldlie jeda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_TSK.1;Infrastructure & Roads;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TSK.1;TSK features a custom building system, built around an upgradeable provincial infrastructure & roads. From the beginning of the game infrastructure is handed out to provinces - based on the region the province is based in and further influenced by the rank of the holder. So in most cases, you'll encounter a blocker when upgrading buildings - infrastructure. Infrastructure can be upgraded by right clicking on the capital holding in a province, with up to five levels possible. Do be warned that infrastructure has upkeep, and it isn't a great idea to upgrade it all at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

During the two days of traveling a host of loyal knights arrived to join us.\n\n As you lay in bed preparing to sleep for the night you hear the distinct sound of a sword being unsheathed and the eventual clash of swords. The guards outside your tent are cut down before your eyes, you attempt to reach your sword, but you're too late. You feel the blade enter and exit your stomach. The last words you can make out before dying are ""None alive--- Roland wishes none to know---.""";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA8157;Damn him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDEAD2;With the timely death of my father I must now stabilize the realm. I could gain prestige and renown by invading the Riverlands, this would allow me to prove to my vassals that I am a worthy King, or I could stay within the safety of the Vale and consolidate my power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_WERWD.10;To Plant a Weirwood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_WERWD.10;A blanket of clouds hung high in the reddening sky, blotting out the last dregs of light, when a guard approached you about an unexpected visitor.

EVTOPTA1000109048;We must hurry and finish this tour of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109049;It’s been many years since I’ve surveyed my realm. Undoubtedly things have changed since then, and some of my courtiers suggest this would be a good time to travel the land once more and see how my realm is doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109049;I’ll think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109050;After deliberation with your advisors and family, you have decided to survey your realm. The preparations will take several days, but the experience will be worth it. After all, it is one thing to hear of how your realm is doing, but another to see it with your own eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109050;I cannot wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109050;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] makes preparations for the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109051;Readying your horses, carriages, and entourage, you leave your residence early in the morning. You will probably be gone for a month or so as you try to learn more about your realm. What do the nobles do when youï¾’re not around? How are the commoners surviving? Which regions prosper, and which languish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109051;So many things to find out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109052;You are about half-way through your survey of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109052;Onward! We still have more traveling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109053;Your survey of the realm is almost complete. There is only a little bit more traveling to do. It might be a good time to reflect on everything that has happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109053;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109054;Your survey of the realm is coming to a close, and you are almost home. The sight of your residence in the far distance is a welcoming sight, indeed. Nevertheless, you have learned much from your journey, and hopefully these lessons will serve you well in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109054;Still, there’s no place like home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109055;While traveling, you happening upon a strange merchant from the far east who calls himself “Qi Ma the Liar.” Insisting on speaking in the third person, he greets you while twirling his cat-like whiskers: “Qi Ma knows much, tells some. Qi Ma knows many things others do not.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109055;I’m bored. Let’s see what this eccentric fellow knows.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109055;I shouldn’t associate myself with strange references.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109056;Qi Ma says, “So many Andal kings kill their firstborn sons. Some say because he is not as intelligent as the second son. Some say because he is not as strong as the third son. Some say the daughter will make a better heir. Qi Ma is glad his parents loved him no matter what.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109056;Um... I think my parents loved me too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109057;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma loves Westeros and the Free Cities. Many interesting events that happen to them. Much more than in Yi Ti.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109057;I sense deja vu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109057;Wait, didn’t this already happen?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109058;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma has heard that people of Dorne are too dark, people of North are too ugly, and people of Westeros and the Free Cities all look the same and boring. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.” ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109058;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109058;No. Some are better than others!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109059;Qi Ma says, "Qi Ma always sees Valyrian nobles playing chess in their spare time. He thinks they have nothing better to do when they aren’t plotting against each other.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109059;Interesting observation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109059;We Valyrians just love our chess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109059;That’s why the Valyrian Freehold was overrun by its enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109060;Qi Ma says, “Some do not know, but the Most Devout is open-minded on some things more than others. Qi Ma has heard that the Septons will elect a follower of R'hllor or a Dothraki warrior as High Septon if they accept having no name!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109060;Well, that’s ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109071;While traveling in the countryside, your entourage discovers a seemingly abandoned bandit camp. Curious, you explore the camp, only to be immediately ambushed by bandits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109071;Let’s fight these cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109071;Run away! Retreat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109072;You and your entourage comes across a horrific scene while patrolling some of the nearby roads: an entire caravan of merchants, massacred, possibly by bandits, business rivals, thieves, who knows what! Some of your men suggest you loot all their belongings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109072;Why not? They won’t need their belongings in the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109072;No. We should give them a proper burial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109061;A small band of robbers foolishly attacked me while I was surveying my realm! My bodyguards easily defeated them, and the survivors are now at my mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109061;Release and make them vow to find honest jobs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109061;Imprison them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109061;Execute them on the spot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109062;I and my party come across the skeleton, half-buried in the mud, its hand still clinging onto a sword. This dead man must have bravely fought to the death before meeting an unfortunate end. Perhaps we should give him a proper burial?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109062;Let’s give him a proper burial, first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109062;Pray for his soul and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109075;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bury the skeleton and then set up camp for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109075;Saddened that such a man did not receive a proper burial, you decide to properly bury the skeleton yourself. That night, the ghost of the fallen man comes to you in a dream. Thanking for your kindness, he tells you of a small treasure he buried, and its location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109075;So... he said walk five hundred steps to the north...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109075;It would be dishonorable to steal such a treasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109063;While surveying the realm, you stay at a small outpost one night. However, you can’t help notice how it is falling into disrepair. Discussing the matter with the outpostï¾’s commander, you learn the outpost doesnï¾’t have the funds for a renovation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109063;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109063;Give the outpost some funds from your treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109063;Bring in expert builders and resources from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109064;You have come to one of the larger settlements in your realm. Tired from all your traveling, you decide to visit the city’s pleasure quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109064;To the whorehouse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109064;I’ll just get a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109064;A walk and fresh air is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109064;I should go pray at the local church instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE1000109064;I should go pray at the local mosque instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF1000109064;I should go pray at the local temple instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109065;Tonight I am staying in one of the fortresses of my realm. It is a mighty fortress, built with the sturdiest wood and toughest stone, yet to your horror you learn that the warriors guarding this fort are horridly incompetent and untrained - they can’t even hold their swords and spears the right way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109065;Give funds to assist these soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109065;Bring soldiers and supplies from elsewhere to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109065;I should help train these fellows myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109066;Your journey through your realm continues. Up ahead, you spot a dirty, impoverished village. Although it is almost night time, and you must find a place to rest, a member of your entourage suggests you move on. “After all, we shouldnï¾’t mingle with these disgusting peasants.ï¾”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109066;Dirty or not, we’ll rest here tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109066;Let’s leave this stinkhole!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109067;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] rests in the village for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109067;Your stay at the impoverished village was worse than you imagined - all the mud, insects, manure, and unidentifiable substances! However, the villagers, honored by your presence, decide to present you with small gifts as you are about to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109067;Refuse it - they need it more than me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109067;Thank you very much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109067;I demand more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109067;Let’s give them some of our belongings instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109068;Today I am visiting a holy site in my realm. I’ve just arrived, and someone should be showing me around this place sometime soon...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109068;Pray for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109068;Pray all day long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109068;Offer donations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109068;Let’s move on, who cares about this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109069;Today I am stopping by one of my vassalï¾’s residences. However, the food prepared doesnï¾’t taste that good, to be honest. I almost vomited, but managed to trick my host into thinking I was choking on something.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109069;Thank you for the great food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109069;This ‘food’ tastes worse than manure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109069;Iï¾’ll help them find better food supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109069;I don’t mind the taste. It’s just... different.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109080;While traveling in the forest, you come across a lost child. Crying, the little girl says she was playing with her friends in the forest when she got lost, and she hasn’t been home in several days. After giving her a bit of food, she tells you that she lives in a nearby settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109080;Leave her. She deserves it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109080;Let’s help the poor child find her way back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109081;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] entourage escort the little girl back to town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109081;You escort the little girl back to a nearby city, and learn that her father is in fact one of the wealthiest merchants in the city. Crying tears of joy, the merchant tightly embraces his daughter, before offering you a great reward for finding his little girl.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109081;No need for the reward, I’m only doing my duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109081;Why thank you, I am such a good person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109081;Don’t worry about it, my children are crazy too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109082;While staying at one of the local holdings, I’ve met a talented guard captain. He is quite capable in military matters, despite being of low birth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109082;Impressive. You set an example for us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109082;Why don’t you come to my court?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109083;While traveling, your entourage comes across what at first appear to be soldiers of your realm. After talking with them for a while, you realize they are bandits masquerading as your own soldiers! Where could they have stolen their disguises?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109083;Arrest them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109084;Today I am resting at one of my realm’s cities. Sitting near the window, I can hear the many conversations townspeople are having outside - the gossip, the rumors, the fears, the hopes, the anger, the happiness, the sadness... There are so many interesting things they say to each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109084;Did you know one of the guards used to be an adventurer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109085;Today I am resting at one of my realm’s villages. Sitting near the window, I can hear the many conversations peasants are having outside. Frankly, though, it’s a little hard to understand the peasants, given they are uneducated and can’t express themselves well, but it’s educational nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109085;Someone saw a crab in the mud the other day, horrible creature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109086;Today while my entourage and I stopped in one of my realm’s villages, one of the inhabitants ran up to me. He whispered to you how he needed your help, how everybody in the village was conspiring against him. “Come meet midnight behind that building there,” he says. “I’ll tell more. We must not be seen!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109086;Ignore the madman and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109086;Well, I don’t see what harm can come of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109087;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] meets the town eccentric behind the large building at night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109087;As the day progressed, you asked the villagers about this madman. They say he’s just the town eccentric, a harmless fool. Nevertheless, when you meet him at midnight, he insists that the villagers are about to kill him. Taking out a large axe, he requests you give him permission to kill them all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109087;Guards! Arrest him! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109087;Ah, let him be, he looks harmless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109088;While on the road, you come across a traveling merchant who specializes in exotic sweets and delicacies from other lands. Currently he is selling off some of his baklava - syrupy pastries from the Free Cities - and offers you some at a discount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109088;I’ll buy some. What is this baklava stuff, anyways?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109088;I’ll buy some. Baklava is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109088;I’ll try one or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109088;No, I’m not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109089;Today I am traveling alongside some farmland. Suddenly, I come across a handsome city boy harassing a pretty peasant girl. Apparently it seems like this fool is trying too hard to win the affections of this girl. Perhaps I should intervene in this amusing scene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109089;You, boy, stop harassing that girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109089;You, boy - learn how to woo a lady properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109089;They remind me of my younger self.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109089;Bring the pretty girl to my camp tonight whether she likes it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE1000109089;Bring the handsome boy to my camp tonight whether he likes it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109090;As I travel on the road today, Iï¾’ve come across a wandering musician. He says he can play me a good song if I spare him a coin or two.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109090;Bah, who wants to hear your noise?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109090;Sure, sure - sing, my good man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109091;Listen to the musician sing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109091;The musician’s song is beautiful indeed, an epic, lyrical tale of heroes and villains, love and war, and too many other things to name. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109091;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109092;Having traveled for several days, you come across a large estate. Hundreds of peasants are out in the fields, working hard to ensure the crops are taken care of in a proper manner. It is quite a wonder to see where all your food comes from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109092;This is the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] at work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109092;An amazing testament of the power of men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETsurvey.1.desc;Today we just left a small and quaint town, and are now about to cross a small stream. I decide to rest for a bit near this stream, which locals say has healing properties.

VIETsurvey.2.desc;While visiting one of the cities in your realm, you decide to go to a local tavern incognito. You happen to hear one man criticizing your rule.

VIETsurvey.2.a;An interesting man! I should bring him to my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.2.b;He shall be arrested and taken to the local prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.2.c;His ideas are good - I should recommend him to the mayor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.3.desc;In one of the towns you visit, people are complaining about the local tax collector. They say he extorts more taxes than you require, and even keeps a small amount for himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.3.a;What a terrible person! We should imprison him at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.3.b;Why should I care? I’m still getting the taxes I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.4.desc;Today I visit one of my vassals, and we discuss various local issues affecting his domain, be it the ability of his levies, the amount of food his land can produce, the amount of trade that goes through, and so on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETsurvey.5.desc;Your party comes across a traveling noble and his bodyguards. Oddly, the noble doesn’t seem to recognize you, perhaps because he appears to be a rather low-ranked one who has never met you.

VIETsurvey.6.a;It is nice to see that my realm’s soldiers are competent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.7.desc;Today I met one of the nobles of my realm, who was traveling on some personal business.

VIETsurvey.7.a;Our conversation was very pleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.8.desc;While traveling, I’ve been talking a lot with one of the lesser knights accompanying me. We donï¾’t agree on everything, but I’ve found our conversations fruitful and delightful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETsurvey.8.b;I’ve learned a lot about how my realm’s soldiers are doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.9.desc;We came across an old, abandoned mine today. Who knows how prosperous it was when it was still in operation centuries ago? Regardless, there wasnï¾’t much to see, but I did find a few valuable stones lying around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VIETsurvey.10.a;A sad tale. Hopefully you’ll survive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.10.b;I can offer a bit of gold to help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.11.desc;You and your fellow travelers happen to meet with a small caravan of merchants. As it so happens, you both are headed to the same city. The merchants, seeing that you and your men are well-armed, request that you escort them to their destination. “The men we hired to protect us stole some of our goods and ran off,” they explain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.11.a;Very well, we will protect you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.11.b;No, I don’t have time. You’ll slow us down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.11.c;Help you? Why don’t we just take your goods instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.12.tooltip;Escort the merchants to the city nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.12.desc;As you approach the city gates, the lead merchant tells you, “Thank you so much for protecting us. We can take care of ourselves from here. We don’t have much, but we wish to offer a few of our valuable merchandise in return for your kindness.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.12.a;Please keep that, you’ll need it more than me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.12.b;Thanks! It has been a pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.13.desc;You happen to come to one of your realm’s villages. The villagers report that a number of troublesome bandits have been raiding their village for some time, but the local authorities haven’t bothered to send any men, being busy with other matters. They beg for you to assist them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.13.a;I will send for a few of my soldiers as soon as I come home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.13.b;Why should I care about you dirty commoners?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.13.c;I feel obligated to teach them how to defend themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.14.tooltip;You spend some time teaching the villagers basic fighting techniques and military discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.14.desc;Impressively, the newly raised militia learned a lot in a short time. Just as you finish a training session, the bandits come back and attack. Under your command the villagers defeat and kill many of them. You are very proud of the villagers - no longer will they live in fear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.14.a;Continue maintaining the militia, and you will do well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.15.desc;One of the young men who fought in the militia was impressed with your leadership ability, and while he isnï¾’t of noble blood, wishes to serve under you. This man in particular was one of the more outstanding fighters during the battle against the bandits, slaying many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.15.a;Your village needs you more than me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.15.b;Good. You will bring your village much honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.16.desc;My men and I come across some bandits on the road, and handily defeat them. While inspecting their stolen goods, we find a young girl tied up. After freeing her, she says she is from a nearby town but was kidnapped - her family, though, was unable to pay the ransom. She begs for you to escort her to town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.16.a;I see. Let’s escort her back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.16.b;Men, leave us two alone. I want to have my way with this pretty thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.16.c;She’ll be a burden, so I wish her good luck finding your way back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.17.desc;As you prepare to have your way with the girl, against her wishes, one of your guards - who you know as a bold young man with a great sense of justice and virtue - pleads for you to stop and control yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.17.a;You’re right. I’m… ashamed. Let’s just escort her back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETsurvey.17.b;How dare you question me? Begone and let me enjoy myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCtsk.0117;You are awoken early in the morning by the sound of your door opening. Your Castellan announces himself and tells you of a disturbing rumor. There have been many reports of a hooded figure moving throughout the lower city in the dead of night.

# FAITH OF THE SEVEN
the_seven;Faith of the Seven;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_seven_DESC;The Faith of the Seven, known to the First Men as "The New Gods", is the religion of the Andals. Unlike the Old Gods, the followers of the Seven believe in one god with seven aspects, with each aspect representing one part of life or existence. These aspects are: The Father, who represents justice. The Mother, who represents peace. The Maiden, who represents purity. The Crone, who represents wisdom. The Warrior, who represents strength. The Smith, who represents creation, and The Stranger, who represents death. The faith is a rigidly organized and practiced religion, with the central holy text being The Seven-Pointed Star.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE SEVEN GODS
the_seven_gods;The Seven Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_seven_gods_DESC;The Seven Gods is a heresy of the Faith of the Seven, which instead interprets The Seven to instead be seven different gods, instead of seven aspects of a single god. This makes it more similar to the worship of the Old Gods, and was likely influenced by it. While the heresy would not gain traction or noble followers, the misconception of there being seven gods instead of the seven aspects would remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE MOTHER
the_mother;The Mother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_mother_DESC;The Mother is a heavenly aspect of The Seven, who represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. Her veneration is quite popular amongst the faithful, with certain heresies coming to venerate her as the leader of the Seven, instead of The Father. Followers of this heresy were known to be more tolerant of female leaders in general, and thus may have female Septons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE SMITH
the_smith;The Smith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_smith_desc;The Smith is a heavenly aspect of The Seven, who represents creation and labour. Followers of The Smith believe he will bless them with aid on large projects, and that they will benefit from his power in their daily lives. This imbalance has caused them to be seen as heretical in the eyes of the Most Devout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE STRANGER
the_stranger;The Stranger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_stranger_DESC;The Stranger is a heavenly aspect of The Seven, who represents death and the unknown. The Silent Sisters are known to serve him, as they are tasked with preparing the dead for funerals. Due to the many different representations of the Stranger, it is unknown if those who follow the Stranger worship all of his variations, like the Seven, or if they group his representations into one god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE OLD GODS
old_gods;Old Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods_DESC;The Old Gods of the Forest, or simply the Old Gods, is the traditional animistic faith of the Children of the Forest, adopted by the First Men. It is vastly different from the Seven, as there is no rite, no uniform prayer, and no organized clergy. What is uniform of the religion however, is the sacredness of the godswood, and the weirwood trees that normally inhabit them. These places are usually where the followers of the Old Gods take to pray, and to listen to their gods. The gods of the faith are nameless and numberless, and the children believed that each weirwood was inhabited by one of the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# BEYOND-THE-WALL OLD GODS
old_gods_beyond;Beyond the Wall Old Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods_beyond_DESC;Much like their southern cousins, the First Men that inhabit the lands beyond the wall worship the Old Gods. Unlike them, however, they are more primal and rural, with the gods being more natural beings that inhabit the lands around them, such as springs and the sacred weirwoods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE WHITE ONES
old_gods_beyond_white;The White Ones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods_beyond_white_DESC;In the farthest reaches beyond the wall live savage, almost animalistic men, who live a harsh, cold life near the Lands of Always Winter. Here, the influence of the Others is most felt, and as such, the men nearest their domains offer sacrifices and worship to them, so that they might be spared their icy wrath. Besides legend, little conclusive information is known about the Others, but it is generally accepted that a deity called the Great Other is their peer, and thus is the one whom receives the sacrifices and prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE LADY OF THE WAVES
lady_of_the_waves;Lady of The Waves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lady_of_the_waves_DESC;The Lady of the Waves was the polytheistic religion of the Sistermen. It was one of four faiths followed by the First Men, but unlike the other three, it did not survive the Andal invasion of Westeros. This faith believed in two deities, the Lady of the Waves, and the Lord of the Skies. Little is known of the religion, or its practices and myths, but it was said that storms, which were believed to be sacred, were the result of the Lady of the Waves mating with the Lord of the Skies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE VULTURE
vulture_god;The Vulture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vulture_god_DESC;The Vulture was a henotheistic faith of the Stone Dornishmen of the Red Mountains. Little is known of this faith, as it was quickly extinguished during the Andal and Rhoynar invasions of Dorne. It is speculated that it was an offshoot of the mainline Old Gods faith, focusing on raiding and the imagery of great vultures that could be skinchanged by greenseers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

drowned_god_DESC;A patron to most Ironborn, the Drowned God is the god of the seas, who commands the Ironborn to reave and reap in his name. All Ironborn who die in glorious battle are sent to his drowned halls and are waited on by mermaids. Drowning is a central theme to the religion, as all practitioners are ritually drowned at birth, for what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# THE STORM GOD
storm_god;Storm God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
storm_god_DESC;The Storm God is the eternal, sworn enemy of the Drowned God, who dwells in a keep high in the clouds and sends his ravens to the world to wreak havoc upon his enemies. Most who believe in the Storm God would see him as an enemy, thus making worship of him after the Age of Heroes quite rare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# R'HLLOR
rhllor;R'hllor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
rhllor_DESC;R'hllor, known as the Lord of Light, the Red God, the Heart of Fire, and the God of Flame and Shadow, is the main deity in the dualistic religion of the same name.

Magic and ritual are rife in this religion, and their followers await the day that Azor Ahai, the Prince that was Promised, will be reborn and defeat the Great Other.

# MOONSINGERS
moonsingers;Moonsingers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
moonsingers_DESC;Braavos was a city founded by slaves who escaped from the mines of Valyria. These slaves were mostly composed of Jogos Nhai, and the Moonsingers are the priestesses of these people, who worshipped the moon and sang birthsongs.

Since then, many other gods have have had their temples established on the Isle of the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# FACELESS GOD
faceless_men;Faceless God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
faceless_men_DESC;The Faceless Men are those who worship the Many-Faced God. The only people known to worship him are the Faceless Men, a guild of expert assassins who believe that they do his work with their assassinations. Unique to him is the lack of a single symbol representing him, for death is universal in the pantheons of men, and so he goes by many names, such as the Stranger, or the Lion of Night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# MAIDEN OF THE HARVEST
maiden_of_the_harvest;Maiden of the Harvest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maiden_of_the_harvest_DESC;The Maiden of the Harvest is a Pentoshi deity that is sometimes mistaken as an aspect of the Maiden from the Seven. While both are deal with the harvest, the Maiden of the Harvest is an actual goddess, while the Maiden is merely an aspect of the Seven. Followers of the Maiden of the Harvest are deeply aware of the seasons around them, as most of their feast days and holy traditions come near Autumn. a core belief of the Harvest Maiden is the relationship of the Moon and Sun, with the Moon being the various forms of physical representation of the Harvest Maiden, and the Sun filling in for the Maiden as she rests during the day, providing Her with warmth and graces for the crops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

boashi;Boash'i;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
boashi_DESC;Boash, the Blind God, is the patron deity of Lorath. The priests of Boash, known as the Boash'i, are eunuchs who wear eyeless hoods to honor their god, as they believe that being blinded like their god will allow them to learn of higher truths. They believe that all life is sacred and eternal, and in the equality of men and women, lords and peasants, rich and poor, slave and master, and even that of man and beast. Another part of the worship of Boash is the extreme abnegation of oneself, to the point of his followers abandoning their names and referring to themselves as 'a man' or 'a woman'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# BOASH'I (REFORMED)
boashi_reformed;The Greater Way of Boash'i;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_seven_DESC;The Faith of the Seven, or the New Gods, is the primary religion of the Andals. Unlike the Old Gods, the followers of the Seven believe in one god with seven aspects, with each aspect represents one part of life or existence. These aspects are The Father, who represents justice, The Mother, who represents peace, The Maiden, who represents purity, The Crone, who represents Wisdom, The Warrior, who represents Strength, The Smith, who represents creation, and The Stranger, who represents death. The faith is a much more rigidly organized and practiced religion, with the central holy text being The Seven-Pointed Star. Regions are ruled by septs, who then answer to the high septon, the leader of the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_seven_gods;The Seven Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_seven_gods_DESC;The Seven Gods is a heresy of the main Seven faith, which instead interprets the Seven to instead be seven different gods, instead of seven different aspects. This makes this practice more in line with the Old Gods, and was likely influenced by them. While the heresy would not gain traction or noble followers, the misconception of there being seven gods instead of the seven aspects would remain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_mother;The Mother;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_mother_DESC;The Mother is a heavenly aspect of the Seven, whom represents mercy, peace, fertility, and childbirth. Her veneration is quite popular already amongst the Seven, but certain heresies would come to venerate her as the leader of the Seven, instead of the Father. Followers of this heresy were known to be more tolerant of female leaders in general, and thus may have female septons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_stranger;The Stranger;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_stranger_DESC;The Stranger is the heavenly aspect of death in the Faith of the Seven, whom represents death and the unknown. The Silent Sisters are known to serve him, as they are tasked with preparing the dead for funerals. Due to the wildly different representations of the Stranger, it is unknown if those who follow the Stranger worship all of his variations, like the Seven, or if they group his representations into one god.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_smith;The Smith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_smith_desc;The Smith is the further worship of one of the tenets of the Faith of the Seven, as its own monotheistic religion. Followers of the Smith believe he will bless them with aid on large projects, and that they will benefit from his power in their daily lives.\n\n This imbalance has caused them to be seen as heretical in the eyes of the Most Devout.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lady_of_the_waves;The Lady of The Waves;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lady_of_the_waves_DESC;The Lady of the Waves is the polytheistic religion of the Sistermen. It was one of four faiths followed by the First Men, but unlike the other three, it did not survive the Andal invasion of Westeros. This faith believed in two deities, The Lady of the Waves, and the Lord of the Skies. Little is known of the religion, or its practices and myths, but it was said that storms, which were believed to be sacred, were the result of the Lady of the Waves mating with the Lord of the Skies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vulture_god;The Vulture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vulture_god_DESC;The Vulture is the Henotheistic faith of the Stone Dornishmen of the Red Mountains. Little is known of this faith, as it was quickly extinguished during the Andal and Rhoyane invasions of Dorne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods;The Old Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods_DESC;The Old Gods of the Forest, or simply the Old Gods, is the traditional animistic faith of the Children of the Forest, and then the First Men. It is vastly different from the Seven, in that there is no rite, no uniform prayer, and no organized clergy. What is uniform of the religion however, is the sacredness of the godswood, and the weirwood trees that normally inhabit them. These places are usually where the followers of the Old Gods take to pray, and to listen to their gods. The Gods of the faith are nameless and numberless, and the children believed that each weirwood was inhabited by one of the gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods_beyond;Beyond the Wall Old Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods_beyond_DESC;Much like their southern cousins, the First Men that inhabit the lands beyond the wall worship the Old Gods. Unlike their southern cousins however, they are more primal and rural, with the gods being more natural beings that inhabit the lands around them, such as springs and the sacred weirwoods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods_beyond_white;The White Ones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
old_gods_beyond_white_DESC;In the farthest reaches beyond the wall live savage, almost animalistic men, whom live a harsh, cold life near the land of Always Winter. Here, the influence of the Others is most felt, and as such, the men nearest their domains offer sacrifices and worship to them, so that they might be spared their icy wrath. Besides legend, little conclusive information is known about the Others, but it is generally accepted that a deity called the Great Other is their peer, and thus is the one whom receives the sacrifices and prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

drowned_god;The Drowned God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
drowned_god_DESC;A Patron to most Ironborn, the Drowned God is the god of the seas, who commands the Ironborn to reave and reap in his name. All Ironborn who die in glorious battle are sent to his drowned halls and are waited on by mermaids. Drowning is a central theme to the religion, as all practitioners are ritually drowned at birth, for what is dead may never die, but rises again, harder and stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
storm_god;The Storm God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
storm_god_DESC;The Storm God is the eternal, sworn enemy of the Drowned God, whom dwells in a keep high in the clouds and sends his ravens to the world to wreak havoc upon his enemies. While most whom believed in the Storm God would see him as an enemy, thus making worship of him after the Age of Heroes quite rare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Unique to him is the lack of a single symbol representing him, for death is universal in the pantheons of men, and so he goes by many names, such as the Stranger, or the Lion of Night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

maiden_of_the_harvest;Maiden of the Harvest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maiden_of_the_harvest_DESC;The Maiden of the Harvest is a Pentoshi deity that is sometimes mistaken as an aspect of the Maiden from the Seven. While both are deal with the Harvest, the Maiden of the Harvest is an actual goddess, while the Maiden is merely an aspect of the Seven. Followers of the Maiden of the Harvest are deeply aware of the seasons around them, as most of their feast days and holy traditions come near Autumn. a core belief of the Harvest Maiden is the relationship of the Moon and Sun, with the Moon being the various forms of physical representation of the Harvest Maiden, with the Harvest Moons is the most holy object to her followers, as it represents her full physical representation. and the Sun being a 'ringer' of sorts, filling in for the Maiden as she rests during the day, and providers Her warmth and graces for the crops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

boashi;Boash'i;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
boashi_DESC;Boash, the Blind God, is the patron deity of Lorath. The priests of Boash, known as the Boash'i, were eunuchs who wore eyeless hoods to honor their god, as they believed that being blinded like their god would allow them to learn of higher truths. Boash'i believed that all life is sacred and eternal, and in the equality of men and woman, lords and peasants, rich and poor, slave and master, and even that of man and beast. Another part of the worship of Boash was the extreme abnegation of oneself, to the point of abandoning their names and spoke of themselves as 'a man' or 'a woman'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

the_dragon_gods;The Dragon Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
the_dragon_gods_DESC;With the discovery of Dragons, and the Valyrians developing a tradition of Dragon riding, it was only natural that some would eventually begin to see the Dragon as a living god.

the_plundering_dragon_DESC;With the discovery of Dragons the Valyrians discovered their most powerful weapon.

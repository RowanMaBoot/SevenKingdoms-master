The Validator is a tool to scan through thousands of files and to find errors in them.

TO USE (brief instructions)
1. Open Validator.exe
2. Fill in the "Game Path" field at the top. This will be something like "C:\Program Files\Hearts of Iron" or "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Crusader Kings II". In particular, it should NOT be anything like "C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\<some game>\..."
3. Choose the appropriate game from the list on the right.
4. If you are using moddir, fill in the "Mod Name" field. This is generally the final name of the .mod file (without the extension), or the name listed inside the .mod file. The Validator should give you a valid list of mod if you enter an incorrectone.
5. Click on "Validate", at the top right, and wait for validation to run.

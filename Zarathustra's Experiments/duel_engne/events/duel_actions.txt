# Here are duel actions defined that is

namespace = duelengine

#
#
# duelaction.0 - prepare list of actions
# duelaction.1 - clear list of actions 
# duelaction.2 - pick action
# duelaction.3 - resolves action (triggered from duelengine)
#  
# external:duelengine.4 - trigger after picking action
# external:duelengine.5 - trigger after resolving action
#
# Ranges:
# Mechanics:          0-9
# Action definitions: 10-99
# Report events:      100-199
# Duel outcomes:      200-x
#
# The rest are action definitions!
# 
# INIT EVENT SET THE AMOUNT OF ACTIONS
# 
# duelaction.0 This event is first and most important it checks 
# if action is available to characer and give this action an #
# unique id so it can be displayed as an option in duel event
